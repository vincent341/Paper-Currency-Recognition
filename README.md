## Introduction
Recognition of paper currency serial number is of great importance for anti-counterfeit and currency tracing and also basic requirements for advanced currency sorter and currency counter. A novel algorithm was proposed to recognise paper currency serial numbers for a public limited company JULONG Co.,Ltd. (stock code 300202). The accuracy of recognition is 99.7% while the time consumption is within 5ms. The proposed algorithm has passed the examination and now runs in the currency sorters of banks both in China and Europe.
